# Steerable 3D Spherical NeuronsThe official implementation of the "Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons" paper, Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2022, 17-25 July, 2022[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13863) [[bibtex]](https://github.com/pavlo-melnyk/steerable-3d-neurons#citation)![The effect of rotating a spherical neuron](misc/3d_neuron_rotation_effect.png)![Regular tetrahedron construction](misc/regular_tetrahedron.png)## Requirements> ðŸ“‹We achieved the original results with Python 3.7.10, ```torch==1.8.1```,  ```scipy==1.6.1```, ```numpy==1.20.3```. Other dependencies include ```matplotlib``` and ```tqdm```.To install the requirements, run:```pip install -r requirements.txt```## DatasetsThe ```utkinect_skeletons_data``` folder contains the 3D skeleton data that we extracted and preprocessed from [UTKinect-Action3D dataset](http://cvrc.ece.utexas.edu/KinectDatasets/HOJ3D.html). The preprocessing and data split are described in Section 5.1 in the paper.## DemoThe ```demo_[dataset_name].ipynb``` notebooks demonstrate a step-by-step construction of the proposed steerable spherical model, as well as the experiments with the corresponding datasets reported in the paper.## Citation
